# OLVERIUS' TREASURE FILTER. SIMPLE. ELEGANT. USEFUL.
## Greetings, dear adventurer. 
## This creation is the product of my own vision, designed to reveal only the most valuable items, and only those trigger notifications.

## Description:
### UBER STRICT shows ONLY the valuable materials and items, including the best white bases, both plain and multi-socket types, the best yellow, some sets, uniques, and all crafted items while hiding everything else. Suitable for high-level endgame, 99-pushing, solo self-found (SSF), and group self-found (GSF) playstyles.
### SOFT STRICT shows PRIMARILY valuable materials and items, including the best white bases, both plain and multi-socket types, the best blue, some yellow, all sets, uniques, and crafted items while hiding everything else. Suitable for leveling, crafting, solo self-found (SSF), and group self-found (GSF) playstyles.
### REGULAR shows shows ALL valuable materials and items, including the best white bases, both plain and multi-socket types, most blue, all yellow, sets, uniques, and crafted items while hiding everything else. Suitable for leveling, crafting, solo self-found (SSF), and group self-found (GSF) playstyles.
